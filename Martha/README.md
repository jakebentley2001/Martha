After doing some research I have found several interesting items to think about

Datasets:
    - Food 101 


Systems
    - Segmentations
    
    - Classification
        - Aparently ResNet architeture is good. This is a 2023 literature review on the best performing model structures on food datasets. https://www.mecs-press.org/ijeme/ijeme-v14-n2/IJEME-V14-N2-5.pdf. This is an example github of someone training a ResNet 50 model on the food 101 dataset https://github.com/Pyligent/food101-image-classification/blob/master/README.md
        - We can also look at DenseNet which I think is similair to ResNet. This is a github describig the finetuning of a DesNet-161 model on the Food 101 dataset. https://github.com/Prakhar998/Food-Classification
        - Clip also looks slightly promising but not really. Here is an article describing its performance https://www.labellerr.com/blog/performance-of-clip-over-food-classification-dataset-here-are-the-findings/
